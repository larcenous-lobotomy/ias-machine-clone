LANGUAGE USED - Python3.8

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS - 1) Change the name of one of the memoryK.txt to memory.txt (to select) before you execute.
                         2) cd into the IAS folder and execute "python3 IMT2019083_main.py"

RESULT - Successful compilation implies that the operation has been performed. The initial and final memory is printed onto the console for inspection. By set convention, the upper part of the memory contains the instruction arrays while the lower part contains the word memory. 
	 The class heirarchy of the code mimics the IAS architecture.
	 The file IMT2019083_ias.py assembles all the components of the IAS computer, and handles the Fetch and Execute. The ISA is stored here, including the mappings of instruction to binary index. 
         The IMT2019083_main.py is the main file that actually runs the code.
